***SHIPBATTLE***

ShipBattle is a small 2D game built with Raylib where multiple ships move around a map, fire projectiles, and try to eliminate each other. The logic focuses on lightweight movement physics, basic projectile trajectories, and simple collision handling between ships, terrain, and bullets.
